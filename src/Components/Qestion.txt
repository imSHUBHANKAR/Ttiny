Develop a frontend in Reactjs or Nextjs, which does the following:

1). On first load, only has a Submit button
2). On clicking on Submit, it will fetch the contents of https://www.terriblytinytales.com/test.txt
3). Parse the content and find the frequency of occurrence of each word (some words will occur only once, some twice and so on, and some will occur N times)
4). Then on the frontend, plot a histogram of the 20 most occurring words.
5). Also build an "Export" button, which when clicked will download a CSV file of the histogram data.
X-axis = top 20 words with highest occurrence Y-axis = how many times they occurred in the file.



Expected solution: 

1. The source code should be uploaded to github along with a readme file. Readme must explain components of the code and mention all libraries and plugins used.

2. Extra points for hosting this solution on Heroku/Netlify or somewhere online. All details must be on the github readme.
